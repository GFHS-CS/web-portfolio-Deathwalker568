           <h2>Evaluation</h2>
           <p>The site I chose was <a href="https://www.sleepnumber.com/">Sleepnumber.com</a></p>
           <p>The purpose of this website is to show what types of beds and other things that they have and are selling. They show images to make sure people are able to see what the products look like.</p>
           <p>The website meets these guidelines pretty well. It didnt take long at all to load into the website meaning that their images werent to horribly big file size wise. The images work pretty well and dont make it so the only thing you can see is the picture. They managed it well.</p>
            <h2>Graphic file types</h2>
            <dl>
                <dt>Pixels</dt>
                <dd>Small dots you see if you put your face too close to your television or computer screen</dd>
                <dt>Resolution</dt>
                <dd>Indicates the number of pixels that are displayed per inch for an image (or pixels per centimeter)</dd>
                <dt>Lossy Compression</dt>
                <dd>When compressed, they lose some of the image details to make the file smaller</dd>
                <dt>Lossless Compression</dt>
                <dd>When you compress the picture you wont compromise the picture</dd>
                <dt>JPEG</dt>
                <dd>Allows up to 16 million colors and is the best choice for image with many colors or color gradations (especially photographs)</dd>
                <dt>PNG</dt>
                <dd>Newer image format that provides a combination of many features of both jpeg and gif</dd>
                <dt>SVG</dt>
                <dd>XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation</dd>
                <dt>GIF</dt>
                <dd>“lossless” image format, meaning that the quality of the image is not degraded through compression</dd>
