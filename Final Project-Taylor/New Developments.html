                <dd>Since technology is always changing that means that there is always new technology being made. New developments include Robot dexterity, New-Wave Nuclear Power, Gut probes in a pill, and even custom cancer vaccines.</dd> 
                <dt>Robot Dexterity</dt>
                
                <dd>Robot dexterity is the ability of robots to "pick up a component on an assembly line with amazing percision and without ever getting bored".

                <dt>New-Wave Nuclear Power</dt>

                <dd>New-Wave Nuclear Power is a new safer and cheaper source of power. Among them are generation IV fission reactors, an evolution of traditional designs.</dd> 

                <dt>Gut Probes</dt>
                <dd>What the gut probes do is let the patient swallow a device that is capable of dpture detailed pictures of the gut without anesthesia. It works even with babies and children.</dd>

                <dt>Custom Cancer Vaccines</dt>
                <dd>Custom cancer vaccines incite the body's natural defenses to destroy only cancer cells by identifying the mutations in the tumor. Scientists are close to releasing the first personalized cancer vaccine.
