            <h1>What is Technology?</h1>
            <p>Technology is defined by Google as "the application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes, especially in industry". Technology can be seen everwhere we go through the world. Whether it's as simple as our cell phone or as hard to see as the nano technology. Technology was originally made to make doing things in life a whole heck of a lot easier. The downside of technology is that things can malfunction with it and do the opposite of it's original purpose. Technology in the long run is well worth the effort it takes and can change our world for the better.
